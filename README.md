 # Tactile Maps

<!--- SUMMARY A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.  --->
The Tactile Maps are designed to help users with visual impairments learn to navigate different types of intersections with various traffic signs and signals. Maps can be used separately as a learning tool for specific intersections and traffic signs and signals, or can be connected together to plan routes between locations.
The legend includes Braille labels for the different representations of traffic signs and signals.

## Getting Started
<!--- 
Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.
 --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Tactile_Maps_BOM_v1.0.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Tactile Maps.

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components requested by the user.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Tactile Maps.
Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/Tactile_Maps_Maker_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build the maps.
